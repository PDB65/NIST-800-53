## ðŸ“œ NIST Special Publication 800-53B
The publication provides baseline security control selections for federal information systems and organizations, complementing NIST SP 800-53 by offering tailored control sets for different impact levels (low, moderate, and high). It streamlines the implementation of risk-based cybersecurity practices by aligning control baselines with system categorizations under FIPS 199, thereby supporting consistent and efficient security and privacy program development across the federal enterprise.

## âœ… Best Practices Recommended
**Automation:** Use tools to scan, deploy, and validate patches across the environment.
**Prioritization:** Patch the most critical vulnerabilities first, based on real-world risk.
**Integration:** Align patch management with broader IT and security frameworks (e.g., NIST CSF, RMF).
**Communication:** Ensure coordination across IT, security, risk, and business teams.
**Documentation:** Maintain records of patch status, exceptions, and decisions for compliance and audits.
