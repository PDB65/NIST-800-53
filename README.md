## ðŸ“œ NIST Special Publication 800-53B
The publication provides baseline security control selections for federal information systems and organizations, complementing NIST SP 800-53 by offering tailored control sets for different impact levels (low, moderate, and high). It streamlines the implementation of risk-based cybersecurity practices by aligning control baselines with system categorizations under FIPS 199, thereby supporting consistent and efficient security and privacy program development across the federal enterprise.
